HOW TO START YOUR SERVERS - IMPORTANT!
========================================

YOUR PROJECT LOCATION:
- Your actual project is in: /Users/shawn/Desktop/CBG/CBG-new
- NOT in /Users/shawn/Desktop/CBG (that's just the parent folder)

TO START THE SERVERS:
1. Open Terminal
2. Navigate to your project:
   cd /Users/shawn/Desktop/CBG/CBG-new

3. Run the start script:
   ./start.sh

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Always use ./ (dot slash) before the script name
- The dot means "current directory"
- Never use just / (slash) - that looks in the wrong place
- Wrong: /start.sh
- Right: ./start.sh

WHAT THIS STARTS:
- Frontend on http://localhost:3000 (your calendar dashboard)
- Backend on http://localhost:3001 (API server)

TO STOP THE SERVERS:
- Press Ctrl+C in the terminal, or
- Run: killall node

IF THE SCRIPT DOESN'T EXIST:
The start.sh script should be in your CBG-new folder.
If it's missing, ask Claude to recreate it.

COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:
1. Being in the wrong folder (must be in CBG-new)
2. Typing "Start both servers" (that's not a command)
3. Using /start.sh instead of ./start.sh
4. Running scripts from CBG instead of CBG-new

QUICK COMMAND REFERENCE:
cd /Users/shawn/Desktop/CBG/CBG-new    # Go to project
./start.sh                              # Start servers
killall node                            # Stop servers
