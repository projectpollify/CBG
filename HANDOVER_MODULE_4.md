## What Needs to Be Done ðŸ“‹

### 1. Push to GitHub (Immediate)
```bash
# The commit is already made locally. To push:
# Option 1: Install GitHub CLI
brew install gh
gh auth login
git push origin main

# Option 2: Use personal access token
# Go to GitHub.com â†’ Settings â†’ Developer settings â†’ Personal access tokens
# Generate token with 'repo' permissions
# Then run: git push origin main
# Use your GitHub username and the token as password
```

### 2. Email Integration (Remaining 5%)
The email templates are ready but need actual sending capability. Choose one:

#### Option A: SendGrid
```bash
npm install @sendgrid/mail
```

Update `/backend/src/services/emailService.ts`:
```typescript
import sgMail from '@sendgrid/mail';
sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY);

// In sendInvoiceEmail method, replace the mock with:
const msg = {
  to: to,
  from: 'info@cuttingboardguys.ca',
  subject: customSubject || this.generateEmailSubject(invoice.invoiceNumber),
  html: this.generateInvoiceEmailHTML(invoice, companyInfo),
  cc: cc,
  bcc: bcc
};
await sgMail.send(msg);
```

#### Option B: AWS SES
```bash
npm install @aws-sdk/client-ses
```

#### Option C: SMTP (Gmail/Outlook)
```bash
npm install nodemailer
```

### 3. Environment Variables Needed
Add to `/backend/.env`:
```
# Email Service (choose one)
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_api_key
# OR
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your_email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your_app_password
```

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Dashboard shows real stats
- [x] Customer page loads all 791 customers
- [x] Invoice creation with line items
- [x] Tax calculations (GST + PST)
- [x] Invoice view/edit/delete
- [x] Settings save without popups
- [x] Reports show revenue and tax data
- [ ] Email sending (pending provider setup)

## Quick Start for New Session
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd /Users/shawn/Desktop/CBG/CBG-new/backend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Frontend  
cd /Users/shawn/Desktop/CBG/CBG-new/frontend
npm run dev

# Terminal 3 - Push to GitHub
cd /Users/shawn/Desktop/CBG/CBG-new
git push origin main  # Will need authentication
```

## API Endpoints Reference
- GET/POST `/api/invoices` - List/Create invoices
- GET/PUT/DELETE `/api/invoices/:id` - Single invoice operations
- POST `/api/invoices/:id/send` - Mark as sent
- POST `/api/invoices/:id/pay` - Mark as paid
- GET `/api/invoices/stats` - Statistics
- GET/PUT `/api/invoices/settings/all` - All settings
- GET/PUT `/api/invoices/settings/company-info` - Company info
- GET/PUT `/api/invoices/settings/service-pricing/:type` - Service prices
- GET/PUT `/api/invoices/settings/tax-rates` - Tax configuration

## Known Issues Fixed
- âœ… Customer edit page field mapping (contactName vs name)
- âœ… Settings page alert popups (now auto-dismiss)
- âœ… Customer page loading (useEffect dependencies)
- âœ… Invoice page imports (cbg-shared â†’ @/../../shared/src)

## Next Steps for Email
1. Choose email provider (SendGrid recommended)
2. Get API credentials
3. Update emailService.ts with actual sending code
4. Test with a real invoice
5. Push final changes to GitHub
